# Asteroids

Attempt at a clone of the classic arcade game in JS. Still under construction.

## Getting it running locally

* Clone the repo.
* Make sure you have [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v14.17.6 installed.
* `yarn && yarn start`
* Point your browser to `localhost:8080`
* Enjoy the feeling of using JS to turn electricity into heat.
